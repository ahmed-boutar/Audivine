A restless anthem for tomorrow’s dreamers, this image hums with the static of cities that never sleep. “Tomorrow is back,” it shouts in red neon, but the words are tangled—delayed, reversed, a bomb ticking in the corner of your mind. Spray paint halos and scratched-out faces haunt the walls, graffiti kings and queens crowned by hope and regret.
Another voice whispers, “Another is possible,” echoing through torn posters and revolution’s faded ink. Fighter jets streak across the chaos, a burst of rebellion against the monotony of print and politics, while scribbled crowns and wild arrows point every which way—lost, searching, insistent.
This is a song of restless hearts, of futures postponed and dreams rewritten. It’s the chorus of a thousand voices layered in static and spray paint, promising that even when tomorrow is late, possibility still pulses beneath the noise.
